# Harp

New app by <a href="http://persad.me/" title="Nick Persad">Nick Persad</a><br>
Initial commit 8/25/2015

Right now, Harp uses the <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api.html">iTunes search API</a> to find songs and utilizes [soundcloud](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/reference) to stream(very buggy). My goal is to have it search and stream music from any device.
